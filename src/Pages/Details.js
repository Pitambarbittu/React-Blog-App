Shah Rukh decided to remove the nameplate from its place of public accessibility for the time being,” the friend reveals."

    "description": "Top Gun Maverick box office day 1 collection: Tom Cruise's film collected $51 million at the US box office on its opening day. In India, it collected ₹4.75 crore. Top Gun came out in 1986, establishing Cruise, then 24, as an action hero. He’s nearly 60 now, promoted to US Navy captain in the sequel, and working hard to recreate the magic from 36 years ago.Director Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun Maverick, which features Tom Cruise, had a contrasting opening at the box office in India and the US. In the US, the film collected $51 million on its opening day. The film is already Tom’s best opening day ever beating Mission Impossible – Fallout's first-day collection. However, the film has not been able to make a mark in India and collected ₹4.75 crore on day one. In Top Gun Maverick, Tom essays the role of Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell, who is grappling with the diminished standing of fighter pilots in a world that now wages war with drones controlled by people miles away on computers. Top Gun Maverick is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie and David Ellison.As per a Deadline report, Top Gun Maverick at this Friday night hour is on its way to a $51 million opening day (which includes $19.3 million previews). It would not be shocking to wake up on Saturday morning and see that the sequel has edged out Iron Man 2 ($51.2M) to become Paramount’s top opening day ever. Already, the sequel is Tom Cruise’s best opening day ever in US/Canada besting Mission: Impossible – Fallout‘s first day of $22.8M by 124%."

Amber countersued for $100 million, saying he smeared her when his lawyer called her accusations a hoax.A seven-person jury deliberated for more than two hours on Friday and will resume discussions on Tuesday. At the centre of the legal case is the December 2018 opinion piece by Amber in the Washington Post, in which she made the statement about domestic abuse. The article never mentioned Johnny by name, but his lawyer told jurors it was clear that she was referring to him"

But if he does win, what does that mean for Amber? We take a look.Johnny has sued Amber for $50 million saying she defamed him when she claimed to be a victim of domestic violence in a Washington Post op-ed in 2018. Johnny’s lawyers have said that even though Amber didn’t name him, the implication damaged his career. He has further alleged that Amber was abusive towards him during their marriage. Amber has countersued him for $100 million claiming that he has smeared her name by calling her a liar. She has maintained that she suffered physical and sexual abuse at Johnny’s hands. Both trials ran concurrently in a Virginia court for over six weeks. The hearings ended on May 27."

    "description": "Hollywood actor Jake Gyllenhaal took a conscious decision to stay in New York, but he admits his soul is in Los Angeles.For a lot of people, real life is deeply connected with the acting world, and sometimes even mirrors it, but that doesn’t stand true for Hollywood star Jake Gyllenhaal.I think real life shapes you as a human, and acting shapes your imagination. I strongly believe that acting is not real life in any form,” Gyllenhaal tells us.It’s been over three decades since Gyllenhaal has been working his way through in Hollywood, bringing different shades of complicated men on screen from cons to police officers. He is known for films such as Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, Zodiac, Nightcrawler, Spider-Man: Far from Home, The Guilty and Ambulance.Opening up about his method as an actor, the 41-year-old shares, “A lot of times people say that acting is pretend. I don’t believe acting is pretend. I think it’s a real access to your imagination and a sense of play. And then you can hopefully build the human you are with the stuff that has nothing to do with the acting, but more to do with life and the people you love and the things you go through good and bad”"

    "description": "Tom Cruise's Top Gun Maverick has been projected to earn $125 million in its opening weekend, which will comfortably make it he best opener in the actor's long career.As per trade reports, Tom Cruise’s upcoming film Top Gun: Maverick could end up registering the biggest opening by any film of his career. Despite his stardom, Tom has never had a film gross over $100 million on the opening weekend. But reports say that Maverick may just change that. Some estimates claim that the film could end up making $125 million in its opening weekend in the domestic market alone.According to a report in The Hollywood Reporter, “Top Gun 2 is easily headed for the biggest opening of Tom Cruise’s career at the domestic box office, with a four-day gross of at least $92 million, according to official tracking. And that’s a conservative estimate. Many pundits believe the critically acclaimed sequel could soar well north of $100 million domestically, but tracking — one of Hollywood’s favorite pastimes — has become fraught in the pandemic era. Exhibitors are especially bullish on the pic, and are even thinking $125 million-plus.”"

Sometimes, it is an eclipse, sometimes it is a meteor shower. But no matter what event, it is an occasion that you should not miss. Here, we have put together a list of celestial events that we can look forward to seeing in 2022.After the partial eclipse visible in certain parts of South America on April 30 this year, there is only one more solar eclipse left for us to witness: a partial one that will happen on October 25 and will be visible in Europe, Northeast Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia, including India. The greatest part of the eclipse will be visible to viewers in India so save the date on your calendar.The total lunar eclipse that occurred on May 16 this year will not be the only one this year: another total lunar eclipse is predicted to happen once again on November 8 this year. However, just like the previous full lunar eclipse, it is unlikely that this one would be visible from India. But just like the one in May, the lunar eclipse in November will also presumably be live-streamed by multiple sources, allowing you to catch a glimpse."

    "description": "Indian electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ather Energy has given an official statement about the fire that happened in one of its showrooms in Chennai on May 27. Shortly after the incident was reported, Ather’s official Twitter handle confirmed the fire while saying that no employee was harmed during the incident.According to a statement issued by the company later, the incident happened due to a vehicle that was brought into the showroom for servicing after it had an accident. Since there was a lot of dust and mud on the vehicle, the staff at the service centre reportedly used a high-pressure water wash to clean the vehicle before inspecting it.Ather says that the service team discovered some cracks in the top casing of the battery pack. But by then, water had entered the battery casing due to the high-pressure wash. The company says that letting in water into the battery is an “impossible to solve scenario,” and that the scooter was “moved to a safer area,” as soon as this was observed."

The CMA said it was concerned Google sought to illegally favor its own ad exchange services, while taking steps to exclude the services offered by rivals.“Weakening competition in this area could reduce the ad revenues of publishers, who may be forced to compromise the quality of their content to cut costs or put their content behind pay walls,” said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA’s Chief Executive Officer.Watchdogs around the world have started to home in on the huge power that firms such as Google and Meta’s Facebook wield over ad markets — striking at the heart of the tech giants’ money making machines. Google faces a separate probe by the CMA into possible collusion over the way it operates online display advertising services.The CMA has been examining the way Google buys and sells advertising since at least 2020, saying that its advertising stack is a potential conflict of interest.

It should be quite light and not too heavy to kickstart your metabolism.While both have contrasting opinions, they strongly agreed and upheld the point that you know your body better than anyone else. Hence, it’s important to observe and understand what your body is trying to tell you and do as one may deem fit. They said, if practising yoga on an empty stomach is suiting you better, do that. On the other hand, if it feels like you need something to get a better start, follow that as a part of your routine.    "

    "description": "An estimated 26 per cent of the world’s population or roughly 972 million people have hypertension; and this number is set to increase to 29 per cent by 2025, according to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Hypertension is essentially high blood pressure, and those who suffer from it may not exhibit any symptoms initially as it develops over the course of many years. This lack of symptoms makes it undetectable in time to prevent it or take remedial action, experts say.“Holistic practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness, help handle stress in a productive and effective manner. Devote your efforts to a regular practice of yogic techniques like asanas, pranayama, and meditation practice that will guarantee your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being,” said Grand Master Akshar, a yoga master."

    "description": "Sooraj Pancholi, who loves to work out, is back to the fitness grind after long. His fitness trainer, Pawan Jatwa, recently shared a video in which the Hero actor could be seen flexing his muscles. According to Bala Krishna Reddy Dabbedi, a fitness expert, and co-founder, director at Fittr, people usually think that they can pick up from where they left and that their original strength will be the same — “but that will not be the case”. “It’s easy to compare yourself to the times when you were training regularly. But, if there has been a gap in your gymming routine, it’s reasonable to see a decline in strength, endurance, and overall muscle,” he expressed.Assess again, test your current strength levels and train accordingly, he suggested. “There is something called muscle memory which helps one get back to their previous strength levels and muscle mass, but this takes times — from a few weeks to even some months. Just be consistent and positive till you get there. On resuming, do not start with an intense program. Keep it minimal, start slow, and you may even experience muscle soreness and pain. Eventually increase the intensity with every passing week,” she said."

    "description": "Being physically active can help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A recent study in Diabetes Care found that women who get more steps have a lower risk of developing diabetes, compared to women who are more sedentary.1And a study in the journal Metabolites found that men who are more active have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to men who are more sedentary.2 It seems that physical activity significantly changes the body’s metabolite profile, and many of these changes are associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, says Maria Lankinen, PhD, research scientist, Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Eastern Finland, and one of the researchers on the study published in Metabolites. Increased physical activity also improved insulin secretion.The study published in Diabetes Care focused on 4,838 older women (median age 78.9) without diabetes, who were followed for up to 6.9 years. Their steps were monitored by accelerometers to account for the number of steps and the intensity of steps, which were labeled as light-intensity or moderate- to vigorous-intensity.For diabetes among older adults, our findings indicate that moderate- to vigorous-intensity steps were more strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetes than light-intensity steps, adds John Bellettiere, PhD, an assistant professor of family medicine and public health at UC San Diego, and a co-author on the study."

    "description": "Researchers recruited 105 men and women aged 70 to 77 and split them into three groups. The first performed supervised exercise twice a week with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) at a 90% peak heart rate. The second did moderate-intensity training at 70% peak heart rate. The third, a control group, did at least 30 minutes of daily activity, but at a low intensity and didn't have heart rate measured.There was one major aspect of improvement that wasn't related to heart rate or cortical thickness, Dr. Haberg adds—it was whether the participants felt control over their choices. For example, those who were able to choose their activity, where they exercised, and whether they exercised alone or with a training buddy tended to have more beneficial outcomes.rforming an activity chosen by the individual is key to better brain health, says Haberg. Also, diligently following physical activity guidelines provides a significant cardiorespiratory effect in healthy older adults. That type of control also can be part of maintaining a regular fitness routine, previous research suggests, because it can lead to greater enjoyment with exercise. For example, one study notes that about 50% of participants in exercise programs drop out in the first 6 months, but that those who feel positive emotions tend to have significantly higher levels of program adherence"

    "description": "With summers already here, who doesn’t want to thoroughly enjoy the seasonal fruits that come with it. But if you have diabetes, then you must have been told countless times to consume fruits with utmost caution. Seasonal fruits like watermelon and grapes are high in glycemic index (GI), and thus with it comes the question — Can a diabetic have fruits? Is it safe?However, bursting the myth, a diabetic can enjoy fruits, but simply need to make strategic decisions based on fruit and how much to consume as per its GI as it assists the person in selecting fruit.  Fruits like watermelon have a glycemic index (GI) of 72 per 100 g serving, but one watchful serving of the fruit contains little carbs and will have minimal effect on the blood sugar level.It is safe to consume blackberries, apples, avocados, strawberries, plums, grapefruit, peaches, pears, and cherries in watchful quantity as they have 20-49 GI levels, which technically classifies them as low GI fruit. With lots of fibre and a low GI, these fruits help improve blood sugar tolerance.People who have diabetes are usually advised to keep an eye on the number of carbohydrates and portion size of their meal, even if it contains low GI, which is indeed true. While consuming fruits certain factors such as the ripeness of the fruit that influences its GI should be taken into account."

Not only as spices, but ginger has been a traditional remedy in many cultures for thousands of years. After all, it is loaded with impeccable health benefits. While we have been told time and again that ginger carries innumerable nutritious benefits, it’s rarely discussed that this magical ingredient can also cause side effects.Although the side effects usually happen after excessive intake of ginger, several cases have been witnessed where it aggravates the health issues. So let’s learn more about the side effects.As ginger carries antiplatelet properties, excessive intake of ginger may cause bleeding. Not just this, but if it is consumed with clove or garlic, it further increases the risk of excessive bleeding.The most common symptoms of basic side effects caused by excessive ginger intake are skin rashes, eye redness, dyspnea, itching, swollen lips, itchy eyes, and throat discomfort. In such circumstances, it is advised to immediately seek medical attention.Consuming ginger beyond the prescribed limit of 1500 mg per day may even lead to the risk of miscarriage. Therefore it is advised to avoid too much ginger during pregnancy and intake it only after consulting the doctor"

    "description": "​​ How soon we renounce age-old traditions in the praxis of food, and succumb to the allure of convenience, short cuts, and finished good-looking products. I’m talking about age old dahi or curd. In my grandmother’s home where I lived for the first 15 years of my life and even when we moved lock stock and tapeli to where my parents made their new home, dahi was always made in the kitchen. It was a daily process. Every day milk would be boiled and cooled to room temperature. A medium-heavy bottomed pot would be greased with the previous day’s dahi, which worked like a bacterial curd starter, and the boiled warm milk would be poured in. A wet cloth kept the milk covered as nature created magic, fermented the milk, added wonderfully healthy probiotic characteristics, thickened it and set it to curd. It would take four to five hours on a normal warm, hot and humid Mumbai day, eight to 12 in cold weather, that was it. Sometimes we’d make curd two times a day, just to be able to have it fresh. There was also a kind of romantic uncertainty about how well the curd would set. Sometimes it could set loosely, separating the water from the milk and sometimes it would be firm and silky. After all milk wasn’t bought homogenised, standardised and in a carton, but was bought at the doorstep from a doodhwala, whose honesty was always in question. So obviously, the better the milk the better the curd. The pot of milk with the curd starter would always be kept in a warm place and most importantly left alone. One old ladies’ tale was that you could add a green chilly with its stem intact to help the curd set faster. Ostensibly, the chilly with the stem would not impart any taste but contained certain bacteria that activated the milk to produce protein curdles that turned milk into curd faster. I’d actually never seen that happening in any of our kitchens."

They are said to be the best way to provide nutrition to the body and boost immunity. Every season comes with a variety of grains, vegetables, and fruits and we can’t agree more that they are tastier than the stored ones. However, do you know with time the nutrition value of fruits and vegetables are declining? Yes, you read that right. With time, due to various reasons that nutrition in fruits and vegetables have declined tremendously leaving us with various deficiencies. According to a National Geographic report, the experts find the root of the problem in the quality of soil. In the last few decades, the soil quality has been compromised due to various reasons including excessive chemical use, fertilisers, irrigation and so on. The harvesting methods have changed from natural ways to machineries which has also taken a dig at the health of the soil. Apart from it, due to global warming and climate change, the atmospheric temperature is rising and making the soil lose its moisture even more that do not hold the crops well putting them in risk of losing nutrition.The report also states that due to carbon dioxide increase in the air, the nutrient content of the fruits, vegetables and other crops are pulling down.David R. Montgomery, a professor of geomorphology at the University of Washington in Seattle emphasis on one of the major risks of the lower nutrient value, that is making our immunity low. According to him, “Nutrient decline is going to leave our bodies with fewer of the components they need to mount defences against chronic diseases — it’s going to undercut the value of food as preventive medicine,” state National Geographic."

    "description": "If you are a fitness enthusiast and a vegan, you might be one of the people who have tofu in their meals instead of paneer. While many people find it easily in the supermarket, others may find it difficult to spot tofu at their local stores. If you are one of those people, don’t worry as this simple method can help you make protein-rich tofu at home with just two ingredients – chickpeas and water.Once the tofu is set, you can use it as and when required. It is as tasty as the tofu bought from a store and tofu is as versatile as cottage cheese. It can be used in dry and wet recipes depending on your mood and diet requirements. Chickpea is rich in protein and hence the tofu is a great source of protein to help you complete the daily protein requirement.Soak the chickpeas overnight after thoroughly washing with the help of a strainer under running water.Drain all the water and wash the chickpeas the next day. Add chickpeas with two cups of water in a blender and blend in batches until you have a smooth mixture.Strain the blended chickpeas through a muslin cloth into a bowl. Make a squeezable bag out of the muslin cloth with the mixture in it. Squeeze the blend well to strain it nicely. As the water drains slowly from the mixture, it takes some time to strain the blend.Take the strained blend and put it in a pot. Keep the pot on full flame and let the mixture boil. Once you see bubbles, lower the flame and cook the blend for another half n hour. The mixture will thicken with time. When it is thick enough, put off the flame and let the blend cool down for a while. Leave the mixture in a container for more than 2 hours idle. This will ensure that the mixture sits and the tofu sets properly"
